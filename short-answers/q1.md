# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is a function that calls on itself. The needed "cases" are the base case and the recursive case. The base case is a condition that would stop the iteration as a whole. To keep the iteration going, the function is going to call on itself with the recursive case.
