# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

It is best to use recursion with linked list, graphs, and trees. This is due to their the ability to be broken down into smaller problems that get solved and in turn, they will "make up" the overall solution in the end. If I were to attempt to describe how this looks like in every data structure I mentioned, it would be the following: 

* Linked List: traversing through the list (head to tail), and the possible actions are each node's data being adjusted and/or we are keeping track of something 

* Graphs: it depends on the graph? 

* Trees: traversing from a tree's root to its children, some action is executed while following the order of traversal until we are back at the top (root)
