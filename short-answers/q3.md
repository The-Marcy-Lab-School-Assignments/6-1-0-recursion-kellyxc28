# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer

The benefits are that a complex problem can be broken down into more manageable sub-problems. While doing this, we can use simplified and concise code by having the function call on itself until a base case is met. An example of this is, we normally use loops in class, which can be somewhat lengthy. However, if we do it recursively, the code can be shorter because the self-invoking ability can do part of the work for us. 

The drawbacks tie back to us paying attention to how a stack functions under the hood. We have to pay attention to the call stack and make sure it does not overflow, which can make our program not as efficient. This happens when the base case is not met, the function keeps invoking itself, and then it runs out of memory as a result. Lastly, the process can be confusing for us to follow since the function is invoking itself and once again, doing the work under the hood.
