**What is Recursion in programming?**
> When using recursion, a function is calling on itself with a changing condition passed in until the base case is met. 

**What are two main components in Recursive functions and their purpose?** 
> Base case: stopping point 
>
> Recursive case: re-invoking the function 

**What problems are best solved using Recursion?** 
> Ones where there is a base case, like counting downwards? 

**What are the benefits of writing Recursive functions? What are the drawbacks?** 
> Benefits: complex problems are simplified with concise code 
> 
> Drawbacks: inefficient and consume space on the call stack, stack overflow, and can be confusing
